# WordPress-theme-full-package-example


Hi, I had developed this theme several years ago as a first theme I built from scratch for my first web portfolio and then I prepared it for a full sharing in the market.
The code is not cutting edge (I built it several years ago) but I published it here just as an example of how to structure a whole theme package, maybe for markets publication.

So the point here is not the theme code itself, but showing an example of:
- the organization of the code/files/docs etc.;
- how to put the theme features into a plugin and notify about it and other required and suggested plugins;
- how to produce a useful readme file;
- how to produce a complete and useful theme documentation, not forgetting the basic and newbie info;
- how to prepare demo data;

with the goal of delivering a ready theme package.

It's a quite simple theme so I think it should be useful for the purpose of being a template/reference to a theme package structure.

When I had to figure out how to tackle it I found some reference but didn't find anything like that, a concrete example, so I thought it was relevant to share this.
I hope you find it useful!

If you are curious and want to see a demo of it: http://www.simoneicardi.com/wpthemes/singlepagefolio/

NOTE: Just for the sake of easiness, for you to consulting the files, everything is already unzipped.
In the wild, you are gonna deliver just a zip with the full package. This zip will contain a folder with the documentation pdf's, a folder with the demo data XML and the zip file of the theme.
